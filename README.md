# UCI-Python-Workshop

This repository contains code for a Python Workshop offered by UCI Libraries during Summer 2024. The content of the workshop is based upon lessons from Carpentries workshop.
This is an asynchronous course I decided to take to enhance my Python skills, especially using Python for research.
The focus of this workshop is on data analysis and dealing with csv data files in Python.

My scripts will reflect what I've leraned in this workshop.
